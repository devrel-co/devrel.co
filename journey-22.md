						COVID-19 in 2020 forced the world to undergo major changes. Some may have lost their loved ones or their jobs. However DevRel has an important role to improve in this tragic situation. Because the services and products are being developed to overcome this pandemic, developers are creating them worldwide. And We have to encourage and support them.
					</p>
					<p class="tp-section__text tp-section__text--pc">
						In 2022, the situation is gradually improving. The number of infected people gradually decreases, medical systems are being established, and people are returning to their normal lives. Of course, we still have to be on our guard. We do not know when COVID-19 will change, and recently there has been a war between Ukraine and Russia. The world is becoming more distant and divided.
					</p>
					<p class="tp-section__text is-ja tp-section__text--pc">
						In this rapidly changing world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to hold large conferences and attract people worldwide. For example, my country, Japan, imposes strict immigration restrictions even by global standards: as of April 2022, up to 10,000 people per day may enter Japan, and they must also be quarantined in hotels for a certain period of time. This makes it difficult to enter Japan.
					</p>
					<p class="tp-section__text is-ja tp-section__text--pc">
						So I came up with the idea that I should go if you cannot come. I want to meet you in person and find out what you've been up to and what's going on in the community in your country. "A handshake is worth more than a click " said DevRelCon organizer Mr. Matthew, which is exactly the idea that "offline is worth more than online.
					</p>
					<h3 class="tp-header is-ja">To the west and east</h3>
					<p class="tp-section__text is-ja tp-section__text--pc">
						This trip will divide into two parts: the first trip will be west of Japan and will cover Asia and the EMEA, and the second trip will cover AMERICAS. The target countries and regions will be those where COVID-19 measures are relaxed. Countries with strict COVID-19 control measures have difficult entry and exit requirements.

						If you'd be willing to meet Atsushi, <a href="https://twitter.com/goofmint" target="_blank">please send a mention or DM to @goofmint</a>! No matter if you are an individual or a company! I'd like to say hello to as many people as possible if I'm going to be there. I'd love a message from you!
					</p>
					<p class="tp-section__text is-ja tp-section__text--pc">
						P.S. I'll have to get you something to take back... maybe a Japanese version KitKat? Of course I'll bring my DevRel manga!
